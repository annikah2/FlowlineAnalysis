# FlowlineAnalysis
Some scripts for velocity and strain rate analysis along Antarctic or Greenlandic outlet glaciers.
This code takes velocity input data (e.g., from MEAsURES), computes ice flowlines, and speed/divergence rate along those flowlines in MATLAB.

Main code: flowline_analysis.m
Supplementary code: grdread.m, intense.m, ps2ll.m
Data used here: antarctic_ice_vel_phase_map_v01.nc, rema
